// ðŸ”¹ What is Polymorphism?

// Polymorphism allows the same method to have different behaviors based on the object that calls it. There are two types:

// Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading) â€“ Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
// Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding) â€“ A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
